    "This analysis models the sequential patterning of infrastructure damage in Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion on 24 February 2022. The phenomenon is not just the volume of attacks, but their order and progression over time, specifically, whether an attack in one location or on one type of infrastructure increases the probability of the next attack occurring in another specific location or on another specific type."

It is a single, discrete incident of political violence, coded by its date, location, actors involved, and event type (e.g., \"Battles,\" \"Explosions/remote violence,\" \"Violence against civilians\"). The provided dataset is a time-ordered sequence of these events, specifically those resulting in infrastructure damage.\n",

    "The analysis in the notebook reveals several key features of this phenomenon:\n",
    "\n",
    "Geographic States (Oblast): The analysis is performed at the Oblast (region) level. The rayon (district) level was considered but deemed unsuitable for this model due to a high volume of missing data (35.9% of 24,269 entries). The oblast level, by contrast, had only 0.03% missing data, providing a robust foundation for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure States (Categories): A second Markov model was built to analyze the type of target. The original 26 unique infrastructure types were consolidated into 8 broader, more practical categories: Business, Civillian, Power & Fuel, Government facilities, Resources, Transportation, Other, and Unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Self-Transition Probability: A primary finding, visible in the heatmaps, is the high probability of \"self-transition.\" This means the most likely location or target-type for the next damage event is the same as the current one. This suggests that attacks often occur in clusters or concentrated waves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Support: The transition matrix for Oblast shows a 0.75 probability that a strike in Donetska will be followed by another strike in Donetska.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Support: Similarly, the recoded infrastructure matrix shows a 0.61 probability that an attack on a \"Civillian\" target will be followed by another attack on a \"Civillian\" target.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steady-State Distribution (Long-Term Projections): By repeatedly applying the transition matrix, the model projects the long-term probabilities of attacks. The projections show that the model reaches a stationary distribution (or \"steady state\") quickly, stabilizing by approximately 50 \"strikes\" (events). This distribution represents the long-term forecast for where any given damage event is likely to occur, regardless of where the attacks began.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Support: The long-term projection (After 2000 strikes) starting from \"Luhanska\" shows the highest probabilities of an event occurring in:\n",

    "Dnipropetrovska: ~16.7%\n",
